# Running-Pace-Regression


This is a basic notebook to perform a linear regression on your running data.

Also, a sample notebook has been included.  

I've done this for myself and am sharing, use at your own risk.

Steps I use:

- install anaconda 3.6  https://www.anaconda.com/download/
- create data spreadsheet using excel, libreoffice, etc., save as .csv
- run the notebook
